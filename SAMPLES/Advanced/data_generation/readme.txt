After creating a system you need to test it with data, only some can be entered manually.

A tool that generates thousands or millions of data is needed to test the performance of the system being implemented.

In this first version it only allows the following data:

Full name
Country
E-mail
Salary
Date

The data output is in dbf and csv file.

Place a limit of 1,000,000 records that can easily be deleted.

With the number of names, more than 100,000,000 name data can be created without repeating without problems.

I am analyzing releasing new versions with more data, both input and output, for example: SQL, JSON, etc.
