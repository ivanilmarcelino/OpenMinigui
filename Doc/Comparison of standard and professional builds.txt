🔧 Key Differences Between Pro and Standard Builds

Standard Build:

* Free to download and use.
* Includes a debug version of the MiniGUI library.
* Utilizes the standard Harbour compiler without optimizations.
* Excludes sample applications, utilities, and the SQLRDD library.

Pro Build:

* Available exclusively to donors.
* Features a compressed MiniGUI library without debugging information.
* Employs an optimized Harbour virtual machine tailored for GUI applications.
* Includes advanced components such as the SQLRDD library, sample applications, and utilities.
* Supports additional compilers like MinGW C (32-bit and 64-bit) and Embarcadero C++ 7.70 for Win32.

✅ Reasons to Choose the Pro Build

1. Enhanced Performance:

   * The optimized Harbour VM in the Pro build offers better execution speed and efficiency for GUI applications.

2. Access to Advanced Features:

   * Inclusion of the SQLRDD library facilitates integration with various SQL servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, Oracle, and MS SQL.
   * Provides additional sample applications and utilities to accelerate development.

3. Broader Compiler Support:

   * Compatibility with multiple compilers allows for greater flexibility in development environments.

💡 Conclusion

If your development requires optimized performance, advanced database integration, and access to a broader set of tools and features, the Pro MiniGUI build is the preferable choice. However, for basic applications or initial development phases, the Standard build may suffice.
