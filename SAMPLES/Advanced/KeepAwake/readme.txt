How To Keep Your Computer Awake When You Are Not Actively Using It?

It can be annoying to find your computer asleep when you come back to it after a short break.
Your computer may even sleep while you’re watching a video or during a presentation when you
do not touch the keyboard/mouse for a long period of time. Windows has a built-in power saving
setting that activates after long periods of inactivity – or, at least, what Windows considers
inactivity. 

Windows still haven’t figured out that your PC is active when a video stream is running in the
background, especially when it is not being watched in the full-screen mode. While these settings
can be useful if you use a laptop, there is no reason why you should have to put up with your
computer sleeping while you’re still using it.

There are several ways you can keep your computer awake without having to touch the mouse or
keyboard constantly. Don’t worry if your IT department at work won’t let you fiddle around with
your computer settings, we’ve got that scenario covered here. Also, some users find that there is
no sleep option in Windows 10 or that Windows 10 won’t shut down even when they want it to!
