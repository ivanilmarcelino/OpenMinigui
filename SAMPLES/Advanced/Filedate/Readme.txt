This program was born out of a need of mine.
From the tests carried out I found that the function hb_FSetDateTime()
it doesn't change all the dates, so I decided to force the replacement
applying a new complete C code for date manipulation.
A special thank to Daniele Federico for his ideas during the planning phase.

Updated version with improved error handling, tooltip with properties of previous dates
and use of Tsbrowse instead of the Grid component.
