 * FUNCTION AddTimerToRegistry( hwnd, id, interval )
 *
 * Adds a timer to the internal timer registry.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   hwnd     : The handle of the window associated with the timer (HWND).
 *   id       : The timer identifier (UINT).
 *   interval : The timer interval in milliseconds (UINT).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A logical value indicating whether the timer was successfully added to the registry.
 *   Returns .T. (TRUE) if the timer was added, .F. (FALSE) if the registry is full.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This function is a helper function used to maintain a record of all active timers
 *   within the application. This allows for proper management and cleanup of timers
 *   when they are no longer needed. The registry prevents resource leaks by ensuring
 *   that timers are properly tracked and can be stopped when the associated window is closed.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   The registry has a fixed size (MAX_TIMERS). If the registry is full, the function will return .F.

 *
 * Returns:
 *   A logical value indicating whether the timer was successfully removed from the registry.
 *   Returns .T. (TRUE) if the timer was removed, .F. (FALSE) if the timer was not found.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This function is a helper function used to remove a timer from the internal registry
 *   when the timer is stopped. This ensures that the registry remains accurate and prevents
 *   the application from attempting to stop a timer that no longer exists.

/*
 * FUNCTION HMG_LISTTIMERS()
 *
 * Creates and returns an array containing information about all active timers in the registry.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A Harbour array (PHB_ITEM) where each element represents an active timer. Each timer element
 *   is itself an array containing the following information:
 *     - Element 1: The window handle (HWND) associated with the timer (as a LONG_PTR).
 *     - Element 2: The timer identifier (UINT).
 *     - Element 3: The timer interval in milliseconds (UINT).
 *   If no timers are active, an empty array is returned.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This function is primarily intended for debugging and introspection. It allows developers
 *   to inspect the state of the timer registry and verify that timers are being created and
 *   destroyed correctly. This can be useful for identifying and resolving timer-related issues.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   The returned array is a newly allocated Harbour item and must be released using hb_itemRelease()
 *   when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

/*
 * FUNCTION INITTIMER( hwnd, nIDEvent, uElapse )
 *
 * Initializes a Windows timer that sends WM_TIMER messages to the specified window at regular intervals.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   hwnd     : The handle of the window that will receive the WM_TIMER messages (HWND).
 *   nIDEvent : The timer identifier (UINT). This value must be unique for each timer associated with the window.
 *   uElapse  : The timer interval in milliseconds (UINT). This specifies how often the WM_TIMER message is sent.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A logical value indicating whether the timer was successfully created.
 *   Returns .T. (TRUE) if the timer was created, .F. (FALSE) if the timer creation failed.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This function allows developers to create timers that can be used to perform tasks at regular intervals.
 *   For example, a timer could be used to update a display, check for new data, or perform other periodic actions.
 *   The timer sends WM_TIMER messages to the specified window, which can then process the message and perform the
 *   desired action. The timer ID is used to identify the specific timer when the WM_TIMER message is received.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   The timer identifier (nIDEvent) must be unique for each timer associated with the same window. If a timer with
 *   the same identifier already exists, the existing timer will be replaced.
 *   The timer interval (uElapse) is specified in milliseconds. A value of 0 will cause the timer to fire as quickly
 *   as possible, but this can consume a significant amount of CPU time.
 *   The function also adds the timer to an internal registry for tracking purposes.

 * FUNCTION KILLTIMER( hwnd, nIDEvent )
 *
 * Destroys a Windows timer previously created using INITTIMER.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   hwnd     : The handle of the window associated with the timer (HWND).
 *   nIDEvent : The timer identifier (UINT) of the timer to be destroyed.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A logical value indicating whether the timer was successfully destroyed.
 *   Returns .T. (TRUE) if the timer was destroyed, .F. (FALSE) if the timer could not be destroyed
 *   (e.g., if the timer does not exist or the window handle is invalid).
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This function is used to stop a timer that was previously started using INITTIMER. It is important
 *   to destroy timers when they are no longer needed to prevent resource leaks and ensure that the
 *   application behaves correctly.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   If the specified timer does not exist, the function will return .F. (FALSE).
 *   The function also removes the timer from the internal registry.
